# My Moonshot Action Plan!

## A- Specific short term goal (deadline: the presentation):
My goal is to survey all the moonshot ideas that are already being worked on so that I don't make a redundant moonshot.

## B- Concrete actions to take starting tomorrow :
My concrete action could be surveying people I know and ask if they have problems that need fixing, I can keep the problems that I would be able to fix with a moonshot.

## C- Possible obstacles and anticipated solutions:
My family members and friends might not have any noteworthy problems, in that case, I can ask around on discord or go around forums but that will take a bit longer.

## D- How I will measure my progress:
If I get at least two interesting ideas by the end of the week, I will consider it a success.
